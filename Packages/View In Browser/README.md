Sublime Text 2 - View In Browser
================================

*View In Browser* is a Sublime Text 2 plugin that will open whatever is in your
current view/tab. If the file current open is new and has not been saved a temporary 
file is created (in your default temp directory for your OS) with the extension of 
**.htm** and your browser will open it. However if the current open file is saved
and has a name this plugin will open it in whatever you have set to handle
its type.

By default the keystroke assigned to this plugin is *CTRL + ALT + V*.

## Installation

press *CTRL + SHIFT + P* and find **Package Control: Install Package** and press *Enter*.
Find this plugin in the list by name **View In Browser**.
